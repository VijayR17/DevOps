Shell scripting is writing a sequence of commands for the shell to execute.
It helps automate repetitive tasks like system monitoring, file manipulation, backups, and deployment etc.

Basic Structure of a Shell Script
#!/bin/bash   (#!/bin/bash: Shebang, tells the system which shell to use)
# This is a comment
echo "Hello, World!"   (#echo: Prints output)

Always save the file as script.sh and make it executable.

1. Variables
name="Alice"
echo "Hello, $name"

2. User Input
read -p "Enter your name: " username
echo "Welcome, $username!"

3. Conditionals
if [ "$age" -ge 18 ]; then
  echo "Adult"
else
  echo "Minor"
fi

4. Loops
for file in *.txt; do
  echo "File: $file"
done

5. Functions
greet() {
  echo "Hi $1!"
}
greet "Charlie"

6. Command Line Arguments
#!/bin/bash
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"


Run as:

./myscript.sh hello world


ðŸ§ª Example: Backup Script
#!/bin/bash
backup_folder="/backup"
source_folder="/home/user/documents"
timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

mkdir -p $backup_folder
tar -czf $backup_folder/backup_$timestamp.tar.gz $source_folder

echo "Backup completed at $timestamp"
